LightFIeldRenderer
==================

This is a C++/OpenCV application that takes as input images of an object that are shot from multiple view points. These view points are at a fixed distance from each other and form a grid in a single plane. We can interpolate images for the intermediate view points as well as set the aperture, focus and optical zoom post capture.
